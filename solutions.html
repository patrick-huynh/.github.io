			Walmart, the largest seller of guns in the US, said it would remove items from its website that resembled assault-style rifles.
			The retailer stopped selling high-powered rifles in its shops in 2015, citing low demand.
			In a statement, Walmart said: "We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms."
			In Washington, President Donald Trump urged a group of lawmakers with diverse views to come up with a comprehensive bipartisan solution in a televised meeting.
			Republican leaders in Congress have rejected raising the minimum legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, but Mr Trump said he "would give pretty serious thought to it", despite opposition from the NRA, which supported him as a candidate.

			<p>Trump is supporting the bill that increases background checks among people who are purchasing guns. However, Trump is not doing anything critical that will clearly put an end to the severely high gun-related crimes.
			Speculations have risen the the NRA may be secretly paying the government to keep gun laws loose so people purchase more guns ultimately making profit.
