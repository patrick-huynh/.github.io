			A school shooting is an attack at an educational institution, such as a school or university, involving the use of a firearm(s). Sometimes, because of the number of victims, they are also categorized as mass shootings. School shootings have sparked a political debate over gun violence, zero tolerance policies, and gun control.
			<br/>
			When there is a school shooting, the school enters a state known as a lockdown. A lockdown forces all students and teachers to lock the doors, turn off the lights and close the blinds to mimic an empty classroom. The student and teacher are contained in the classroom until the threat has been eliminated or leaves the presence of the school. Lockdowns are not common but it is critical to practice them incase of an emergency.
			<br/>
			Anyone in the school may be affected by school shootings. From teachers, staff, students and guests, anyone who is involved in a school shooting is at severe risk of being shot.

		<p style="float:right">School shootings are so dangerous because it puts a lot of people in a confined building where the shooter can easily target. In addition, due to the lock down procedure, it puts many students in the building with the shooter, thus allowing the shooter to target more innocent lives. The problem isn't the lockdown procedure, its the fact that these types of people are able to get their hands on such weapons and terrorize innocent students who are just trying to get an education.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50%; margin-top:230px">America has very weak gun laws and as a result, this contributes to the high number of gun-related crime. Compared to other countries with weak gun laws, America has amongst the highest gun-related crimes. America clearly needs stricter gun laws but their government shows no signs of making this happen. Unfortunately, America will continue to face increasing gun-related crimes in the coming future.</p>
